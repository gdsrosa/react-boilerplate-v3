# React Boilerplate

This is a updated version of my v2 boilerplate for React projects, this new v3 now contains a bunch of new stuffs out of the box like Sass, ESLint, React Hooks, Redux and Typescript!

This project uses Redux Ducks pattern. More about this pattern on this link [Ducks Modular Redux](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)
